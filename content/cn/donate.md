If you appreciate my content, please consider donating to charities or nonprofits 
to make the world a better place.

Here are some of my recommendations:

1. **Wikimedia Foundation**  
   The Wikimedia Foundation operates the worldâ€™s most extensive free knowledge base 
   Wikipedia. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained 
   by a community of volunteers through open collaboration and a wiki-based editing system.

2. **Apache Software Foundation**  
   The Apache Software Foundation is an American nonprofit corporation supporting many open-source software projects, 
   including ActiveMQ, HTTP Server, Kafka,
   Lucene, Maven, etc. Here is the [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apache_Software_Foundation_projects) 
   of all Apache Software Foundation projects.  
   Open-source software powers a large portion of today's technology, which has significantly
   improved the efficiency and productivity of societies and changed people's lives.

3. **Linux Foundation**  
   The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit technology consortium founded in 2000 as a merger 
   between Open Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group to standardize [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), 
   support its growth, and promote its commercial adoption.
   A free, open-sourced, and high-performance operating system like Linux is the bedrock of the whole
   tech industry.
