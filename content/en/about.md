# The Name 

The name **LogischerMix** comes from the book [*Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth*](https://www.amazon.ca/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521),
a fantastic book recommended by one of my professors at the business school.

LogischerMix is the German translation of *Logicomix*, for the domain name of *Logicomix* has already 
been registered, and I believe the book name is also copyright protected. 

# Tech Stack

I have been writing and blogging for about **8** years. Starting with blogging platforms,  I once wrote my 
blogging app with Java and experimented with CMS like [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) for
some time.  

Ultimately, I find that my core need here is a place to reflect and write about my thoughts.
All those solutions cost too much energy to configure and maintain, leading to no time and 
mental energy to write after work.  

I decided this time should be different. After some research, I determine a 
static site is the best option. With a static website, I don't need to care about the database, 
hosting server, and other technical details and can focus on writing. I must focus on the core mission and
reducing energy consumption as much as possible.

As a result, this site leverages the famous and influential [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework with 
the [LoveIt](https://hugoloveit.com/) theme and is deployed to [Cloudflare CDN](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) directly. 
[GitHub](https://github.com/JustinQHu/Mblog) hosts the source code, and commits to the repo
would trigger the build and deploy pipeline. 



# Objective

For this site, I hope to bring **high-quality, in-depth** content. Consequently, it is
unrealistic to set a goal of 50+ or 100 + articles per year. 

I aim to produce **10** articles annually, with **thorough study, research, 
and thinking** for each piece.
